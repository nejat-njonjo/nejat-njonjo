### Summary

As a software engineer with a passion for web technologies, I have honed my skills by working on a variety of projects for agencies and startups, both in-house and remotely. My ultimate goal is to create world-class products that are not only useful, but also beautiful and impactful. I thrive on being a part of the entire digital journey, from the initial spark of an idea to the final design and development. As a freelancer, I am able to jump in at any stage of a project and bring my expertise to the table. And I am eager to be part of the innovative technology revolution in Malawi, the warm heart of Africa.
