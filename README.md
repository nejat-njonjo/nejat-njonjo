### Let's Talk about Nejat Njonjo (PanAfrcianChild)

Iâ€™m Nejat Joseph Mhango a full-stack developer.   My focus has been on web technologies. Iâ€™ve worked in-house and remotely on projects for agencies and startups. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I like to be involved at different stages of a digital project, from the seed of the idea to sketches, design and even the front-end. As a freelancer, this means I can jump in at any stage of a project, or take on the whole project, from design to build.

I want to be one of the people contributing to the change of advanced technology in :malawi: Malawi (Warm Heart of Africa).
